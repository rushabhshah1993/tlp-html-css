                        World War 2 started when Hitler's forces tried to invade Poland by going 
                        against the warnings shared by the former Allied Forces. Hitler's Germany
                        was later joined by Mussolini's Italy in their battle against England and
                        France. The war spread outside Europe when the kingdom of Japan and the
                        United States of America also joined the war.
